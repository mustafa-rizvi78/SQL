Key Notes:

•	Apparently, significantly higher percentage of USD currency getting declined arising from countries other than USA itself (namely AE). 
•	Another reason to ask when country like AE is paying in USD instead of local currency.  

•	Is that a normal course of business? Or a slight deviation from the normal course.

•	Acceptance rate took a sharp decline from April to June. Besides, that downward trend, the acceptance rate paints a steady picture (averaging around mid to late 50s)
